# Inspector

The Inspector shows the runtime state of your GastroLog instance — what [vaults](help:inspector-vaults) exist, how much data they hold, which [ingesters](help:inspector-ingesters) are running, and what [background jobs](help:inspector-jobs) are in progress. Open it from the header bar.

Everything here is read-only. To change configuration, use [Settings](help:settings) instead.
