# Saved Queries

Save frequently used queries so you can recall them with a single click instead of retyping them each time.

## Saving a Query

1. Type your query in the search bar
2. Click the ![icon:bookmark]() button (right side of the search bar) to open the saved queries panel
3. Enter a name for the query and press **Enter** or click **Save**

The current contents of the search bar are saved exactly as written — filters, time bounds, and all.

## Loading a Saved Query

Open the saved queries panel and click any entry. The query text is loaded into the search bar, replacing whatever is there. Press **Enter** to run it.

## Deleting a Saved Query

Hover over a saved query and click the **&times;** button that appears on the right to remove it.

## Storage

Saved queries are stored per-user on the server, so they follow you across browsers and devices as long as you're logged in with the same account.
