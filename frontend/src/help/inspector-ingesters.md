# Ingesters

The Ingesters tab shows each configured ingester with its runtime status and metrics.

Each ingester displays its name, type, and whether it's currently running or stopped. Expand an ingester to see:

- **Messages ingested**: Total messages received since the ingester started
- **Bytes ingested**: Total data volume received
- **Errors**: Number of messages that failed to parse or process
