Used by 6 of 7 tabs (all except Certificates which manages state differently).\n\n2. **`<AddFormCard>`** — Wrapper for the add-new-item form. Copper border styling, takes form fields as children, provides Cancel/Create button row via props (`onCancel`, `onCreate`, `isPending`). All 7 tabs use identical markup for this.\n\n3. **`<SettingsSection>`** — Section skeleton: h2 title + 'Add X' button header, loading state, empty state message, and the item list. Takes children (the card list) and an add form slot (ReactNode). Replaces ~30 lines of identical JSX per tab.\n\n4. **`<SettingsCard>` redesign** — The existing SettingsCard needs two changes:\n   - **Header slots**: Support ReactNode slots after the card title for badges (ingester type, enabled/disabled status, 'used by' indicators, etc.). Currently some of this exists via the `status` prop but it should be a first-class pattern.\n   - **Move delete inside the card body**: Delete should NOT be in the title/header row. It should be inside the expanded panel, requiring the user to deliberately open the card before they can delete. This makes accidental deletion harder. The delete button (with its existing confirmation flow) goes at the bottom of the expanded content, visually separated.\n\nEach component accepts children/ReactNode props for custom content (React's equivalent of slots).

The chunk manager's Append always overwrites record.WriteTS with m.cfg.Now(), discarding the original write timestamp. This causes merged records to appear as if they were written at merge time rather than their original ingest time. Time-range queries (which use WriteTS for Start/End bounds) will exclude merged records that fall outside the merge-time window—e.g. a record originally from Jan 1 merged on Jan 15 will have WriteTS=Jan15 and be missed by a query for Jan 1–5.\n\n## Revised approach: move chunks, don't rewrite records\n\nThe query engine already handles overlapping time spans across chunks in the same store via heap-based merge-sort (by IngestTS).

Simplify to two operations: Migrate and Merge.\n\n## Remove CloneStore\n\nDelete the RPC, handler, frontend UI, and hook. No longer needed.\n\n## MigrateStore (three-phase move)\n\nThe primary operation for moving a store to a new name, type, and/or location. Orchestrates existing primitives:\n\n1. **Create destination store** with the same filters/policy as the source, enable it — new ingested data starts flowing there immediately.\n2. **Disable source store and seal all unsealed chunks** — source is now frozen, no new records flow in (back pressure handles in-flight data).\n3. **Merge source into destination, delete source when done** — drains the now-static source into the active destination.\n\nThis avoids the race condition of copying while new data arrives. The source becomes a frozen snapshot the moment migration starts.\n\n## Restrict MergeStores\n\nKeep for consolidating stores, but add safety guards:\n- Target store must be disabled or have no filters applied, to prevent silent data loss from filter mismatches.\n- Auto-seal any unsealed chunks in the source before merging.\n\nNote: the merge restrictions are naturally satisfied during MigrateStore because step 2 disables the source.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"kluzz@radical.org","parent":null,"labels":[],"external_ref":null,"design":null,"acceptance":null,"notes":null,"close_reason":null,"created_at":"2026-02-15T04:56:11.630145+01:00","created_by":"kluzz@radical.org","updated_at":"2026-02-15T15:33:54.404591+01:00","updated_by":"kluzz@radical.org","closed_at":"2026-02-15T15:33:54.404591+01:00","closed_by":"kluzz@radical.org","deleted_at":null,"deleted_by":null,"delete_reason":null,"original_type":null,"comments":[],"duplicate_of":null,"metadata":{}}

But the open aggregation issues (count, time buckets, group-by) are individual features that belong to a larger architectural question: does GastroLog get a pipe-based transformation pipeline?\n\nEvery major log system (Splunk SPL, Kusto KQL, Grafana LogQL, Elasticsearch ES|QL, ClickHouse) has converged on separating two phases:\n\n1. **Filter phase** — boolean search against indexes (what we have today)\n2. **Transform phase** — a pipeline of operators that reshape the filtered result set\n\nThe industry consensus is that pipe-based syntax is the ergonomic winner for interactive analytics. The core operator vocabulary is small:\n\n- `stats`/`summarize` — aggregation with group-by (count, avg, sum, min, max, percentiles, dcount)\n- `bin`/`bucket` — time bucketing with gap-filling and alignment\n- `eval`/`extend` — computed fields from expressions\n- `where` (post-aggregation) — filter on computed values\n- `sort` + `limit`/`top` — ordering and truncation\n- `parse`/`extract` — query-time field extraction (we already have KV extractors at index time)\n\nExample of what this might look like:\n\n```\nservice=\"api\" status>=500 last=1h | stats count, avg(duration), p95(duration) by bin(5m), service | where count > 10 | sort -count\n```\n\nDesign questions:\n\n- What operators do we need for v1? Minimal viable set vs aspirational.\n- How does the pipe boundary interact with the existing scanner pipeline? The filter phase produces records; the transform phase produces tables/time-series. This is a fundamental type change.\n- Result types: search returns records (infinite scroll), pipeline returns tables or time-series (finite, structured). How does the frontend handle both? (see gastrolog-wl16)\n- Approximate algorithms: HyperLogLog for distinct counts, t-digest for percentiles — needed at scale.\n- Do we want conditional aggregation (Kusto's `countif`, ClickHouse's `-If` combinator)?\n- Does `eventstats` (add aggregate back to events without collapsing) matter for us?\n- Query-time field extraction: we have index-time KV extraction already. Do we need `parse`/`rex` style operators for ad-hoc extraction?\n\nThis issue is the architectural design. The existing child issues (gastrolog-316n, gastrolog-5991, gastrolog-5oh4) become implementation tasks within whatever pipeline design we choose.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"kluzz@radical.org","parent":"gastrolog-5g66","labels":[],"external_ref":null,"design":null,"acceptance":null,"notes":null,"close_reason":null,"created_at":"2026-02-22T04:40:43.354331+01:00","created_by":"kluzz@radical.org","updated_at":"2026-02-23T02:52:40.499158+01:00","updated_by":"kluzz@radical.org","closed_at":"2026-02-23T02:52:40.499158+01:00","closed_by":"kluzz@radical.org","deleted_at":null,"deleted_by":null,"delete_reason":null,"original_type":null,"comments":[{"id":"gastrolog-1oep-c1","issue_id":"gastrolog-1oep","author":"kluzz@radical.org","text":"# Pipeline Grammar Design Deliberations\n\n## Research: Industry Survey (SPL, KQL, LogQL, ES|QL, SQL Pipes)\n\nEvery major log/analytics system uses `|` as the stage separator. The left side is always a filter/search, the right side is transformation. This matches GastroLog's existing architecture: the filter phase is already built (boolean query language), and pipes would add the transform phase.\n\n### Two Architectural Models\n\n1. **Table-in, table-out (SPL, KQL, ES|QL):** Every pipe stage receives a table (set of records with columns) and produces a table. Composable — you can chain arbitrary stages. KQL calls these \"tabular operators.\"\n\n2. **Two-mode (LogQL):** Log queries and metric queries are fundamentally different types. `{app=\"nginx\"} |= \"error\"` returns log lines, but `rate({app=\"nginx\"}[5m])` returns time series. You can't freely mix them.\n\n**Recommendation:** Table-in/table-out is cleaner and more composable. Since GastroLog doesn't have a columnar engine, our \"table\" is really \"stream of records with dynamically extracted fields.\" Post-aggregation rows would be synthetic records.\n\n### Core Operator Vocabulary\n\nDespite different names, every system has the same ~8 fundamental operations:\n\n| Concept            | SPL              | KQL              | ES|QL           | Proposed    |\n|--------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| Filter rows        | `where`          | `where`          | `WHERE`         | `where`     |\n| Select columns     | `fields`/`table` | `project`        | `KEEP`/`DROP`   | `fields`    |\n| Add computed column| `eval`           | `extend`         | `EVAL`          | `eval`      |\n| Aggregate          | `stats`          | `summarize`      | `STATS`         | `stats`     |\n| Sort               | `sort`           | `sort`           | `SORT`          | `sort`      |\n| Limit              | `head`/`tail`    | `take`           | `LIMIT`         | `head`/`tail` |\n| Parse/extract      | `rex`/`spath`    | `parse`/`extract`| `DISSECT`/`GROK`| `parse`     |\n| Rename             | `rename`         | `project-rename` | `RENAME`        | `rename`    |\n\n### Time Bucketing\n\nEvery log system has special support for time bucketing:\n\n- SPL: `bin _time span=5m` then `stats count by _time`\n- KQL: `summarize count() by bin(timestamp, 5m)`\n- ES|QL: `STATS count(*) BY BUCKET(@timestamp, 5m)`\n- LogQL: `rate({...}[5m])` (built into metric query)\n\n### Aggregation Kills Row Identity\n\nAfter `stats`/`summarize`, you no longer have log records, you have aggregate rows. This is a one-way transformation. SPL and KQL handle this gracefully because everything is just a table. LogQL makes it a hard type boundary.\n\n### EXTEND vs SELECT Distinction\n\n- KQL `extend`: adds a column, keeps all existing ones\n- KQL `project`: defines full column set, drops others\n- SPL `eval`: acts like extend\n- ES|QL `EVAL` (extend) and `KEEP` (project)\n\nThis matters for log exploration — you usually want to *add* extracted fields while keeping the raw message visible.\n\n## Design Questions (Open)\n\n### A. Table-in/table-out vs two-mode?\n\nLeaning table model. Our \"table\" is a stream of records with dynamically extracted fields. Post-aggregation rows would be synthetic records with only the grouped/computed columns.\n\n### B. Minimal useful operator set for v1?\n\nCandidates for MVP:\n1. `| stats count by <field>` — aggregation (the #1 feature users want from pipes)\n2. `| where <expr>` — post-extraction filtering\n3. `| eval <field>=<expr>` — computed fields\n4. `| parse <pattern>` — field extraction from message body\n\nNice-to-have (not essential for v1): sort, limit, rename, fields/project.\n\n### C. How does `parse` interact with existing KV extraction?\n\nGastroLog already extracts key=value pairs at query time in the scanner. A `parse` operator could use the same mechanism but with user-defined patterns (grok, dissect, regex named groups).\n\n### D. Expression language for `eval` and `where`\n\nNeed a small expression language for:\n- Computed fields: `eval duration_ms = duration * 1000`\n- Post-filter conditions: `where status >= 500 AND duration > 1000`\n\nThis is different from the search-phase boolean logic. It operates on extracted/computed fields, not raw log text.\n\n### E. Result type transition\n\n- Pre-aggregation: stream of log records (infinite scroll in UI)\n- Post-aggregation: finite table of aggregate rows (table/chart in UI)\n\nFrontend needs to detect which result type a query produces and render accordingly (see gastrolog-wl16).\n\n### F. Approximate algorithms at scale\n\nFor large datasets:\n- HyperLogLog for distinct counts (`dcount`)\n- t-digest or DDSketch for percentiles (`p50`, `p95`, `p99`)\n- These can be computed per-chunk and merged","created_at":"2026-02-22T06:28:28.904735+01:00"},{"id":"gastrolog-1oep-c2","issue_id":"gastrolog-1oep","author":"kluzz@radical.org","text":"# Design Decisions (from discussion)\n\n## A.

GastroLog's \"table\" is a stream of records with dynamic columns:\n\n- **Fixed columns**: `_time`, `_msg`, `_store`, `_source`\n- **Dynamic columns**: attributes (set at ingest), extracted KV pairs (discovered at query time)\n\nSparse/dynamic schema — different records have different columns. This is fine; SPL works the same way.\n\nThe key insight is the **materialization boundary**: everything before the first aggregation operator is lazy/streaming. Aggregation forces materialization into a finite result set. Post-aggregation operators work on the materialized table.\n\n```\nfilter                              → streaming records\nfilter | where/eval                 → still streaming records\nfilter | stats count by status      → materialized aggregate table\nfilter | stats ... | where count>10 → filtered aggregate table\n```\n\nThe identity pipeline (`filter |` or just `filter`) passes through raw records unchanged — current behavior.\n\n## B. Minimal operator set — stats + where\n\nv1 MVP: `stats` (with `by`, `bin()`, aggregation functions) and `where` (post-aggregation filtering). Everything else (eval, parse, sort, limit, rename, fields) can come later.\n\nRationale: `stats` is the entire reason pipes exist. `where` after stats is trivial to add and essential for filtering aggregate results. Everything else is ergonomic sugar.\n\n## Frontend result rendering — dynamic\n\nThe UI auto-detects the result type from response metadata and switches renderer:\n\n- **`records`**: log line list, infinite scroll (current behavior)\n- **`table`**: finite grid of aggregate rows\n- **`timeseries`**: chart (time-bucketed aggregation → histogram/line chart)\n\nResponse metadata carries a `result_type` signal. The query structure determines the type — if the pipeline has a `stats` operator, the result is table/timeseries; otherwise it's records.

Backend execution model — Single-pass accumulation\n\nThe aggregation layer sits on top of the existing scanner stream, maintaining a `map[groupKey]aggregateState` in memory. After the scanner is exhausted, it emits result rows. No changes to the scanner. Per-chunk partial aggregation (MapReduce-style) deferred — only relevant for parallel chunk scanning or distributed execution.\n\n## 2. Cardinality explosion — Hard cap with warning\n\nLimit to N groups (e.g. 10,000). Once hit, stop accepting new group keys but keep counting existing ones. Response metadata includes `\"groups_capped\": true` so the frontend can show a notice. No silent distortion, no top-N reshuffling.\n\n## 3. Empty bins — Engine gap-fills\n\nThe engine knows the query time range and bin size. It inserts zero-rows for empty bins. Frontend receives a complete series — no guessing boundaries. Missing points render as zeros, not discontinuities.\n\n## 4. Missing/non-numeric fields — Skip silently\n\nAggregation functions only consider records where the field exists and parses as a number. No error, no count-as-zero. `avg(duration)` across 100 records where 80 have numeric duration computes average of those 80. Consistent with comparison operator behavior (`status>=500` already skips non-numeric values). Optional: response metadata could include skipped field counts.\n\n## 5. Pipe operator ordering — Runtime warning, not parse error\n\nThe parser doesn't track column schemas — that's semantic, not syntactic. If `| where count > 10 | stats count` runs and `count` doesn't exist as a column before stats, the where stage matches nothing and stats gets zero records. The response includes a warning like \"field 'count' not found in any record.\" This also handles legitimately rare fields without false parser errors.\n\n## 6. Follow mode + stats — Disallow in v1\n\nFollow mode is a live tail (infinite stream). Stats needs all records before emitting. Fundamentally incompatible. For v1, the frontend disables follow when the query has a `stats` stage, with a tooltip. Non-aggregation pipe operators (where, future eval/parse) still work in follow mode. Rolling windows / streaming aggregation deferred.\n\n## 7. Protobuf API — Extend Search with oneof\n\nOne RPC, one query string entry point. The server parses the query and returns the appropriate response variant:\n\n```protobuf\nmessage SearchResponse {\n  oneof result {\n    RecordBatch records = 1;   // filter-only: streaming records\n    TableResult table = 2;      // pipeline: materialized table\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAligns with auto-detect rendering — the response itself tells the frontend what it got.\n\n## 8. Cancellation and progress\n\nCancellation: already handled by `context.Context` and Connect RPC client disconnect propagation. No new work.\n\nProgress: server-streaming RPC sends periodic progress frames (`chunks_scanned`, `chunks_total`, `records_matched`) before the final table result. Same pattern as record batch streaming. For v1, even an indeterminate spinner is acceptable — progress frames are polish.\n\n## 9. Frontend data flow — Separate components\n\n- **RecordList**: existing component, infinite scroll, streaming. Untouched.\n- **TableView**: new component, finite grid for aggregate results.\n- **ChartView**: new component, time series when `bin()` is present.\n\nSearch page inspects response variant, mounts appropriate component. During stats query, shows loading state until table arrives. No risk of regressing core search experience.\n\n## 10. Error handling — Three categories\n\n- **Parse errors**: existing mechanism extends naturally. `ParseError` with position, frontend tokenizer underlines. Error position can point into pipe segments.\n- **Runtime warnings**: non-numeric field, unknown field in where. Query still runs, response metadata includes warnings. Frontend shows subtle notice.\n- **Resource limits**: cardinality cap, timeout. Terminal — response includes partial results plus error flag. Frontend shows warning banner.\n\n## 11. Testing strategy\n\n- **Parser tests**: extend `querylang_test.go` for pipe parsing, stats grammar, where-in-pipe, errors.\n- **Execution tests**: new test file in `query/` package. Known records through stats, verify output. Edge cases: empty input, missing fields, cardinality cap, gap filling.\n- **Integration tests**: end-to-end via Connect RPC. Reuse existing infrastructure.\n- **Frontend tests**: tokenizer highlighting for pipe syntax, component tests for TableView/ChartView.","created_at":"2026-02-22T07:46:17.061452+01:00"},{"id":"gastrolog-1oep-c12","issue_id":"gastrolog-1oep","author":"kluzz@radical.org","text":"# Expression Language & Function Calls\n\n## Grammar\n\nThe expression language supports field references, literals, function calls, and arithmetic. It's used in `stats`, `where`, and (future) `eval`.\n\n```ebnf\nagg_expr    = IDENT \"(\" expr \")\" ( \"as\" IDENT )?\n            | \"count\" ( \"as\" IDENT )?\n\nexpr        = IDENT                        -- field reference\n            | NUMBER                       -- numeric literal\n            | STRING                       -- string literal\n            | IDENT \"(\" expr_list \")\"      -- function call\n            | expr op expr                 -- arithmetic\n            | \"(\" expr \")\"                -- grouping\n\nexpr_list   = expr ( \",\" expr )*\n\nop          = \"+\" | \"-\" | \"*\" | \"/\"\n```\n\n## Aggregate vs Scalar Functions\n\nThe parser doesn't distinguish — it builds a uniform expression tree. The evaluator enforces:\n- Aggregate functions (`count`, `avg`, `sum`, `min`, `max`) only valid at top level of `stats` expressions\n- Scalar functions can appear anywhere: inside aggregates, in `where`, in `eval`\n- Aggregates cannot nest inside other aggregates (`avg(count())` is an error)\n\nExample: `avg(toNumber(response_time) / 1000)` → aggregate(`avg`) wrapping arithmetic wrapping scalar(`toNumber`) wrapping field reference. Parser builds the tree; evaluator validates placement.\n\n## v1 Implementation Scope\n\nParse the full expression grammar, but only implement:\n- **Aggregate functions**: `count`, `avg`, `sum`, `min`, `max`\n- **Scalar functions**: `toNumber` (essential — extracted fields are strings, numeric aggregation needs coercion)\n- **Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`\n\nString functions (`len`, `lower`, `substr`, `replace`, etc.) deferred. Grammar is ready for them.\n\n## One language, two contexts\n\nThe expression language is context-agnostic. Both filter phase and pipe phase can invoke it. The caller provides field resolution:\n- Filter phase: record attributes, extracted KV pairs\n- Pipe phase (stats): aggregation over matching records\n- Pipe phase (where): columns from upstream stage\n- Pipe phase (eval): input columns → output columns","created_at":"2026-02-22T07:50:30.898843+01:00"},{"id":"gastrolog-1oep-c13","issue_id":"gastrolog-1oep","author":"kluzz@radical.org","text":"# Expression Precedence & Reserved Words\n\n## Operator precedence\n\nExplicit and documented.

An `eval` adds fields, `rename` replaces them, `fields -` drops them, `lookup` adds suffixed fields, and `stats` replaces the entire schema with aggregation columns. Autocomplete suggestions need to reflect the field set *at the cursor position in the pipeline* — not just the raw record fields. This means the backend needs to simulate the pipeline up to the cursor and report what fields would exist at that point.\n\n## Proposed RPCs\n\n1. **`GetFields`** — Given a query expression + time range + pipeline position, sample matching records, simulate operators up to the cursor, and return the resulting field set. Replaces the frontend's `aggregateFields` + `extractKVPairs`.\n\n2. **`ValidateQuery`** — Given a partial or complete expression + cursor position, return parse errors and contextual suggestions.

This means we can simply **move the source store's chunks (and their indexes) into the destination store** instead of reading/rewriting every record.\n\nBenefits:\n- WriteTS is preserved (fixes the bug)\n- Indexes are preserved (no rebuild needed)\n- Much faster (no record-by-record I/O)\n- No ordering concerns within chunks\n\n### Same-backend merge (e.g. file→file)\nMove/rename chunk directories from source store into destination store. Trivial.\n\n### Cross-backend merge (e.g. memory→file)\nRequires rewriting chunks into the destination backend format. Could use a header flag on the destination chunk to mark it as \"merging\" so the query engine ignores it until the rewrite is complete. Records must be copied preserving all timestamps (WriteTS, IngestTS, SourceTS).

The core operator vocabulary is small:\n\n- `stats`/`summarize` — aggregation with group-by (count, avg, sum, min, max, percentiles, dcount)\n- `bin`/`bucket` — time bucketing with gap-filling and alignment\n- `eval`/`extend` — computed fields from expressions\n- `where` (post-aggregation) — filter on computed values\n- `sort` + `limit`/`top` — ordering and truncation\n- `parse`/`extract` — query-time field extraction (we already have KV extractors at index time)\n\nExample of what this might look like:\n\n```\nservice=\"api\" status>=500 last=1h | stats count, avg(duration), p95(duration) by bin(5m), service | where count > 10 | sort -count\n```\n\nDesign questions:\n\n- What operators do we need for v1? Minimal viable set vs aspirational.\n- How does the pipe boundary interact with the existing scanner pipeline? The filter phase produces records; the transform phase produces tables/time-series. This is a fundamental type change.\n- Result types: search returns records (infinite scroll), pipeline returns tables or time-series (finite, structured). How does the frontend handle both? (see gastrolog-wl16)\n- Approximate algorithms: HyperLogLog for distinct counts, t-digest for percentiles — needed at scale.\n- Do we want conditional aggregation (Kusto's `countif`, ClickHouse's `-If` combinator)?\n- Does `eventstats` (add aggregate back to events without collapsing) matter for us?\n- Query-time field extraction: we have index-time KV extraction already. Do we need `parse`/`rex` style operators for ad-hoc extraction?\n\nThis issue is the architectural design.

Streaming regular records does not exhibit this behavior.\n\n## Likely causes\n\nEach pipeline query generates significant allocation churn with no caching:\n\n1. **Index files re-read from disk every query**: `applyKeyValueIndex` eagerly opens 8+ index files per sealed chunk via `os.ReadFile` + decode (attr KV, attr key, attr value, kv, kv key, kv value, JSON path, JSON PV). No caching — all re-read and re-decoded per query.\n\n2. **Per-record allocations in tight loop**: `BuildRecordCopy` (raw bytes + attrs map copy) and `RecordToRow` (new map + string conversion) allocate for every record, all short-lived garbage.\n\n3. **macOS MADV_FREE**: Go's scavenger marks freed pages with MADV_FREE, which macOS only reclaims under memory pressure. Pages show as Real Memory in Activity Monitor even when reclaimable.\n\n4. **GC timing vs poll interval**: At 5s auto-refresh, the next query fires before GC finishes scavenging from the previous one.\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nUse pprof (`just pprof`, then `go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap`) to confirm whether it's retained references or GC lag. Force GC with `curl http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap?gc=1` and check if RSS drops.\n\n## Potential fix\n\nCache immutable index data for sealed chunks.
