The chunk manager's Append always overwrites record.WriteTS with m.cfg.Now(), discarding the original write timestamp. This causes merged records to appear as if they were written at merge time rather than their original ingest time. Time-range queries (which use WriteTS for Start/End bounds) will exclude merged records that fall outside the merge-time window—e.g. a record originally from Jan 1 merged on Jan 15 will have WriteTS=Jan15 and be missed by a query for Jan 1–5.\n\n## Revised approach: move chunks, don't rewrite records\n\nThe query engine already handles overlapping time spans across chunks in the same store via heap-based merge-sort (by IngestTS). This means we can simply **move the source store's chunks (and their indexes) into the destination store** instead of reading/rewriting every record.\n\nBenefits:\n- WriteTS is preserved (fixes the bug)\n- Indexes are preserved (no rebuild needed)\n- Much faster (no record-by-record I/O)\n- No ordering concerns within chunks\n\n### Same-backend merge (e.g. file→file)\nMove/rename chunk directories from source store into destination store. Trivial.\n\n### Cross-backend merge (e.g. memory→file)\nRequires rewriting chunks into the destination backend format. Could use a header flag on the destination chunk to mark it as \"merging\" so the query engine ignores it until the rewrite is complete. Records must be copied preserving all timestamps (WriteTS, IngestTS, SourceTS).

After migration deletes the old store and creates a new one with a different UUID, the poll loop kept querying the deleted store ID — getting nil back and silently producing nothing.\n\nFixed by re-evaluating the store list on each poll iteration, initializing positions for newly discovered stores so history isn't replayed.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"kluzz@radical.org","parent":null,"labels":[],"external_ref":null,"design":null,"acceptance":null,"notes":null,"close_reason":"Fixed in branch refactor/gastrolog-2vo4 — Follow() re-evaluates store list each poll iteration","created_at":"2026-02-15T18:19:00.428335+01:00","created_by":"kluzz@radical.org","updated_at":"2026-02-15T18:21:39.563932+01:00","updated_by":"kluzz@radical.org","closed_at":"2026-02-15T18:21:39.563932+01:00","closed_by":"kluzz@radical.org","deleted_at":null,"deleted_by":null,"delete_reason":null,"original_type":null,"comments":[],"duplicate_of":null,"metadata":{}}
